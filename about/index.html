For damages with respect to injury to health, body or life caused by us, our representatives or our agents in the performance of the contractual obligations, we are fully liable. We are fully liable for damages caused wilfully or by gross negligence by us, our representatives or our agents in the performance of the contractual obligations. The same applies to damages which result from the absence of a quality which was guaranteed by us or to damages which result from malicious action. If damages with respect to a breach of a contractual core duty are caused by slight negligence, we are liable only for the amount of the damage which was typically foreseeable. Contractual core duties, abstractly, are such duties whose accomplishment enables proper performance of an agreement in the first place and whose performance a contractual party regularly may rely on. Our liability based on the German Product Liability Act remains unaffected. Any further liability is excluded. The limitation period for claims for damages against us expires after one (1) year.</p></li> <li><p>These Terms, their subject matter and their formation, are governed by the laws of Singapore subject only to any mandatory provisions of consumer law in the European Union country in which you reside.
